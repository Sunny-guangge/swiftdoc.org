# SwiftDoc.org

Auto-generated documentation for Swift. Command-click no more.

## Installation

[SwiftDoc.org](https://swiftdoc.org/) is created via a two-step process:

1. The `swiftdoc-parser` utilities parse a set of Swift header files
   and output a set of HTML files with YAML front-matter.
2. Jekyll converts those files,
   along with the remaining files in this repository,
   to create the SwiftDoc.org site.

If you have Jekyll installed,
you can run SwiftDoc.org locally with the following commands:

```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swiftdoc.org.git
$ cd swiftdoc.org
$ bundle install
$ foreman start
```
