    <p>Returns a <code>CVaListPointer</code> built from <code>args</code> that&#39;s backed by
autoreleased storage.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This function is best avoided in favor of
  <code>withVaList</code>, but occasionally (i.e. in a <code>class</code> initializer) you
  may find that the language rules don&#39;t allow you to use
<code>withVaList</code> as intended.</p>
