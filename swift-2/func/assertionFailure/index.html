    <p>Indicate that an internal sanity check failed.</p>

<p>Use this function to stop the program, without impacting the
performance of shipping code, when control flow is not expected to
reach the call (e.g. in the <code>default</code> case of a <code>switch</code> where you
have knowledge that one of the other cases must be satisfied). To
protect code from invalid usage in Release builds; see
<code>preconditionFailure</code>.</p>

<ul><li><p>In playgrounds and -Onone builds (the default for Xcode&#39;s Debug
configuration) stop program execution in a debuggable state
after printing <code>message</code>.</p></li><li><p>In -O builds, has no effect.</p></li><li><p>In -Ounchecked builds, the optimizer may assume that this
function will never be called. Failure to satisfy that assumption
is a serious programming error.</p></li></ul>
