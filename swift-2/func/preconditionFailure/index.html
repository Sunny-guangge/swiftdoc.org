    <p>Indicate that a precondition was violated.</p>

<p>Use this function to stop the program when control flow can only
reach the call if your API was improperly used.</p>

<ul><li><p>In playgrounds and -Onone builds (the default for Xcode&#39;s Debug
configuration), stop program execution in a debuggable state
after printing <code>message</code>.</p></li><li><p>In -O builds (the default for Xcode&#39;s Release configuration),
stop program execution.</p></li><li><p>In -Ounchecked builds, the optimizer may assume that this
function will never be called. Failure to satisfy that assumption
is a serious programming error.</p></li></ul>
