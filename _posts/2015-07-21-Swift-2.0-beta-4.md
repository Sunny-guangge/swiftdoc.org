Xcode 7 beta 4 is available today with the latest revision to Swift 2.0. Along with [indirect enums](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/623567837466984448), beta 4 includes some significant changes to the standard library, including:

- The protocol hierarchy for sequences and collections has been overhauled, with subscripting moved from `CollectionType` to a new `Indexable` protocol. This change, along with the addition of a `SubSequence` type alias inside `CollectionType`, sees the end of the `Sliceable` protocol and the introduction of a new `Slice` struct that can be based on any indexable instance.

- As noted in the release notes, `SinkType` and `SinkOf` are now gone, being replaced by `(T) -> ()` closures in the few relevant functions and methods.

- The [list of free functions](/swift-2/func/) is getting leaner and leaner as functions move into protocol extensions. The extensible and range-replaceable collection have shuffled off their mortal coil this time (along with `ExtensibleCollectionType` itself).
