Xcode 7 beta 6 brings more changes to the standard libraryscape:

- The free function slaughter continues. The newest release guts the remainder of the free functions, moving nearly everything possible into a protocol extension. *Left alone, `abs()` whistles pointedly, refusing to make eye contact with `SignedNumberType` or `AbsoluteValuable`.* Its days are [numbered](https://gist.github.com/natecook1000/91fc96f19265cb86b33a).

- The `Lazy*` group of types and protocols have been updated significantly, with clearer naming and official protocols for `LazySequenceType` and `LazyCollectionType`.

- `MutableSlice`, `MutableIndexable`, and `ReverseIndexType` all join the family to support new mutable collection slicing capabilities. Welcome, everyone!

- Many methods that take closures, like `map`, `filter`, and `contains`, are now marked as `rethrows`, so they can accept throwing closures and pass on any thrown errors.
