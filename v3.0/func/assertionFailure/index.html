<p>Use this function to stop the program, without impacting the performance of
shipping code, when control flow is not expected to reach the call---for
example, in the <code>default</code> case of a <code>switch</code> where you have knowledge that
one of the other cases must be satisfied. To protect code from invalid
usage in Release builds, see <code>preconditionFailure(_:file:line:)</code>.</p>

<ul><li><p>In playgrounds and -Onone builds (the default for Xcode&#39;s Debug
configuration), stop program execution in a debuggable state after
printing <code>message</code>.</p></li><li><p>In -O builds, has no effect.</p></li><li><p>In -Ounchecked builds, the optimizer may assume that this function is
never called. Failure to satisfy that assumption is a serious
programming error.</p></li></ul>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong>
  <strong>message:</strong> A string to print in a playground or <code>-Onone</code> build. The
    default is an empty string.
  <strong>file:</strong> The file name to print with <code>message</code>. The default is the file
    where <code>assertionFailure(_:file:line:)</code> is called.
  <strong>line:</strong> The line number to print along with <code>message</code>. The default is the
    line number where <code>assertionFailure(_:file:line:)</code> is called.</p>
