description: "Swift documentation for '_DestructorSafeContainer': A container is destructor safe if whether it may store to memory on
destruction only depends on its type parameters.
For example, whether Array&lt;T&gt; may store to memory on destruction depends
only on T.
If T is an Int we know the Array&lt;Int&gt; does not store to memory during
destruction. If T is an arbitrary class Array&lt;MemoryUnsafeDestructorClass&gt;
then the compiler will deduce may store to memory on destruction because
MemoryUnsafeDestructorClass&#39; destructor may store to memory on destruction."
