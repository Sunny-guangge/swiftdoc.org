    <p>Invokes the given closure with a mutable pointer to the given argument.</p>

<p>The <code>withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)</code> function is useful for calling
Objective-C APIs that take in/out parameters (and default-constructible
out parameters) by pointer.</p>

<p>The pointer argument to <code>body</code> is valid only for the lifetime of the
closure. Do not escape it from the closure for later use.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong>
  <strong>arg:</strong> An instance to temporarily use via pointer.
  <strong>body:</strong> A closure that takes a mutable pointer to <code>arg</code> as its sole
    argument. If the closure has a return value, it is used as the return
    value of the <code>withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)</code> function. The pointer
    argument is valid only for the duration of the closure&#39;s execution.
<strong>Returns:</strong> The return value of the <code>body</code> closure, if any.</p>

<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <code>withUnsafePointer(to:_:)</code></p>
