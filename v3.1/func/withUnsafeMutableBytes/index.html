    <p>Invokes the given closure with a mutable buffer pointer covering the raw
bytes of the given argument.</p>

<p>The buffer pointer argument to the <code>body</code> closure provides a collection
interface to the raw bytes of <code>arg</code>. The buffer is the size of the
instance passed as <code>arg</code> and does not include any remote storage.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong>
  <strong>arg:</strong> An instance to temporarily access through a mutable raw buffer
    pointer.
  <strong>body:</strong> A closure that takes a raw buffer pointer to the bytes of <code>arg</code>
    as its sole argument. If the closure has a return value, it is used as
    the return value of the <code>withUnsafeMutableBytes(of:_:)</code> function. The
    buffer pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the
    closure&#39;s execution.
<strong>Returns:</strong> The return value of the <code>body</code> closure, if any.</p>

<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <code>withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)</code>, <code>withUnsafeBytes(of:_:)</code></p>
