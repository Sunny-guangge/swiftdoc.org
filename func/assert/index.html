    <p>User code assertions.</p>

<p>User code assertions are only enabled in debug mode. In release and
unchecked modes these checks are disabled.  This means they may have no
effect on program semantics, depending on the assert configuration.
Traditional C-style assert with an optional message.</p>

<p>When assertions are enabled and <code>condition</code> is false, stop program
execution in a debuggable state after printing a message.  When
assertions are disabled in release and fast builds, <code>condition</code> is not even
evaluated.</p>

<p>When assertions are turned off, the optimizer can assume that the
<code>condition</code> is true.</p>
