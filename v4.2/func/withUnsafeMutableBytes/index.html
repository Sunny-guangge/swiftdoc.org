    <p>Invokes the given closure with a mutable buffer pointer covering the raw
bytes of the given argument.</p>

<p>The buffer pointer argument to the <code>body</code> closure provides a collection
interface to the raw bytes of <code>value</code>. The buffer is the size of the
instance passed as <code>value</code> and does not include any remote storage.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong>
  <strong>value:</strong> An instance to temporarily access through a mutable raw buffer
    pointer.
    Note that the <code>inout</code> exclusivity rules mean that, like any other
    <code>inout</code> argument, <code>value</code> cannot be directly accessed by other code
    for the duration of <code>body</code>. Access must only occur through the pointer
    argument to <code>body</code> until <code>body</code> returns.
  <strong>body:</strong> A closure that takes a raw buffer pointer to the bytes of <code>value</code>
    as its sole argument. If the closure has a return value, that value is
    also used as the return value of the <code>withUnsafeMutableBytes(of:_:)</code>
    function. The buffer pointer argument is valid only for the duration
    of the closure&#39;s execution.
<strong>Returns:</strong> The return value, if any, of the <code>body</code> closure.</p>
